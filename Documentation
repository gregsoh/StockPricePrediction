UPDATE:
Implemented KNN once again with several options available (i.e. option 1: if we are deciding whether to buy based on the price k days later and option 2: predicting the actual price k days later). The code can be seen in KNN.py. There is also an additional option to do distance weighting where we do not take the mean but the weighted mean. 

MOVING FORWARD:
I will next code up a LSTM from scratch.
